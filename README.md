# Multimodal Transfer Learning Demos

This repository contains a collection of Google Colab notebooks demonstrating transfer learning, fine-tuning, and generative AI across multiple data modalities — including vision, audio, video, and text. These practical examples use TensorFlow, Keras, and Hugging Face APIs to implement and adapt powerful foundation models.

Each notebook includes a video walkthrough and debug trace for reproducibility and clarity.

## Video Walkthroughs

Each Colab notebook includes a recorded walkthrough explaining:
- What the model does and where it is used
- How transfer learning or fine-tuning is applied
- Debug trace outputs and how to interpret results
- How to adapt the model to custom datasets

Host videos on YouTube, Google Drive, or Loom and update the links above.
